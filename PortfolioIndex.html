                    <h3>Hard work and self disipline</h3>
                    <p>Coding career started at Eastern Michigan university during Covid. Origionally a Biology Major, but didnt see the long term career from that direction. That is when I took a class and was introduced to Java. That was initially my main language I was trying to perfect but never did. Becuase I was a self independent student I had to work full time and go to school part time. As my job Career became more intense and my living more expensive I had to leave school and focus primarily on my Career. I am now in a very important professional positiion and can afford more living. But the truth is I have not been passionate about my career like I was when learning programming. Instead of school I have been learning programming on Codecademy.com. There I have gained enough knowledge to create this very portfolio and many more projects. Hoping to make the Career jump from Warehouse Supply Chain Management to Software Engineering. A more fulfilling career for me.</p>
